to run the code, I installed docker for macOS from:
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
(The Docker Desktop installation includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Notary, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper.)
by launching the docker.app, it will start running

To run the code:
- cd to the project directory and write this command: docker-compose up --build
